<br>
<br>âš¡Project Description: 
<br> This is a simplified version of a popular classifieds service. It includes several product categories, provinces in Poland, and the type of ads for buying/selling. 
<br> Users can post ads, and logged-in users have additional features such as viewing their posted ads and adding ads to their favorites.
<br>
<br>ðŸŒ±Project Goals:
<br>  User Management.
<br>  Adding, filtering, and displaying ads.
<br>  Database communication.
<br>  Array operations.
<br>
<br>ðŸŒ±The project allowed me to develop skills in:
<br>  Array operations such as map, filter, merging arrays, creating new arrays without modifying the base array.
<br>  Component state management.
<br>  Database queries.
<br>  Styling using styled-components.
<br>  Handling logged-in users, login, registration, adding ads to favorites, checking posted ads.
